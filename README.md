# MVVM Android Project Structure

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, better scalability, and maintainability. The structure and setup described here reflect my personal approach, which may vary depending on the developer as each one has their own style and preferences for organizing the project. However, the core principles of MVVM remain consistent.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Model**
- **User.kt**: A data class representing the user model. It defines the structure of the user object that will be used across the application.

### 2. **Repository**
- **UserRepository.kt**: The repository is responsible for handling data operations such as fetching data from APIs, databases, or other sources. It acts as a single source of truth for the data needed by the ViewModel.

### 3. **View**
- **MainActivity.kt**: This is the View in the MVVM pattern. It observes changes in the ViewModel and updates the UI accordingly. It interacts with the UI elements like `RecyclerView`, `TextViews`, etc.
- **adapter/**: Contains `UserAdapter.kt`, which is responsible for binding user data to a `RecyclerView`. The adapter ensures that the UI reflects the current state of the data.

### 4. **ViewModel**
- **UserViewModel.kt**: The ViewModel holds the UI-related data and exposes it to the View through `LiveData`. It interacts with the `UserRepository` to fetch data and updates the `LiveData` observed by the View.

### 5. **Optional Folders**
- **di/**: Contains dependency injection classes if you're using libraries like Dagger or Hilt. DI helps in injecting dependencies into your classes, promoting modularity and testability.
- **utils/**: Contains utility/helper classes that are used throughout the project, such as network handling, string formatting, and other shared functionality.

### 6. **Res (Resources)**
- **layout/**: Contains XML layout files used in the project:
  - `activity_main.xml`: Defines the layout for `MainActivity`.
  - `item_user.xml`: Defines the layout for individual user items in a list, used by `UserAdapter`.
- **values/**: Holds common resources like:
  - `colors.xml`: Color resources for the app.
  - `strings.xml`: String resources for text used across the app.
  - `themes.xml`: Themes and styles used in the app.

### **Key Features of the MVVM Architecture in This Project:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: The Model, View, and ViewModel are separated to ensure cleaner code and better maintainability.
- **Lifecycle Management**: The `LiveData` objects in the ViewModel ensure data updates are handled in a lifecycle-aware manner, which helps in managing configuration changes like device rotations.
- **Modular Design**: The project can be easily scaled, and each component (Model, View, ViewModel) can be individually tested, promoting clean architecture principles.

### **Personal Setup Preferences**
I typically follow this structure while setting up projects, but this may vary between developers, as every developer has their own style of organizing patterns and structure. The organization and file structure here is designed to promote clarity and ease of use for this specific project, but other developers may approach it differently based on their needs and preferences.
